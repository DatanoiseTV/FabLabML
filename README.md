# FabLabML

The FabLabML is a proposed format for Fab(rication) Lab(oratory) needs.
It is based on YAML, a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages. 

## Why?

A unified data format is important if you want to establish a standard for the community. This data
can then be used for things like:

* BuildingOverview Pages
* Sharing Information about the Lab
* Providing search functionality accross Labs
* Making Management easier
